 # Final project 
  
 In a world where we use fitbit's and apple watches, using biometric data coupled with a daily activity log and a mood metric indicator can go a long way in helping us deal with stress. 
  
In my project I aim to use heart rate spikes, correlate them to the time of the day and the activity the person is doing to understand what aspects of a persons life is causing him stress. This can he highly helpful to therapists and counsellors for people with anxiety and substance use disorders to understand the core of the trauma and try various interventions to try and help them deal with those issues based on thie triggers. 

Outline : 
The first aspect of my story will talk about the advent of biometric data and how exactly it's data can be used in predicting stress stages. 

I will then talk about the challenges faced in visualizing biometric data    

I will then talk about how predicting the triggers of this stress can be useful not just to an indiividual but to to the mental health and addiction industries. 

Data : Source of the data is the fitabse website https://www.fitabase.com/resources/knowledge-base/exporting-data/example-data-sets/

Initial sketches : Linking the high heart rate spikes to the activity. 

Another aspect to be added to it is the mood log above the spikes which will be self reported every 2 hours of the day.

The medium I will be using for my final presentation is short hand and I plan to tell the story of the use of biometric data to visualise stress paterns and how important good data visualization is to the success of making this technology evidence based.
