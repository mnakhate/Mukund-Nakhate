# Mukund-Nakhate
Telling Stories with Data
# About me 
My name is Dr. Mukund Nakhate from Mumbai, India and I am pursuing my masters in Healthcare Policy and Management. I am trying to bridge the gap between medical expertise and the non-clinical arms of the healthcare industry. Looking to work with problem-solving, operations, analytics, quality improvement and strategy making from the perspective of a medical professional after graduating.

# What I hope to learn
